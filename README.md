# My React Project Template

This is my personal project template for React apps, which I often use as a base for further configuration. The stack includes Webpack 3, Babel, SASS, fetch() and, of course, React.

The template comes with a few common scripts I use, which I run with `npm run`.

- `build` to create a production uglified build
- `build-dev` to create a dev build
- `watch` to run the watch script
- `devserver` to start a webpack-dev-server
